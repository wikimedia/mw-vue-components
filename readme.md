## Usage

## Version history

This library is [semantically versioned](https://semver.org). See the [changelog](changelog.md) for
release notes.

## Development

### Quick start

```bash
npm i
```

### NPM scripts

- `install` / `i`: install project dependencies. 
- `version`: increment the version and publish a new release. See [versioning](#versioning).

Undocumented scripts are considered internal utilities and not expressly supported workflows.

<details markdown>
<summary>
<a href="http://nvm.sh">NVM</a> is recommended to configure the Node.js version used whenever executing these scripts. Expand for exampleâ€¦
</summary>

```bash
# Install the project's recommended Node.js version. This is a one-time installation command and
# does not need to be run again except when the project's .nvmrc is revised. `nvm use` will print an
# error message if this command needs to be run again.
nvm install "$(<.nvmrc)"

# Configure the current shell's environment to use the recommended Node.js version. This command
# should be run whenever opening a new shell to work on the project _prior_ to executing any of the
# project's NPM scripts, especially `npm install`.
nvm use

# Install the project's development and production dependencies. This is a one-time installation
# command and does not need to be run again except when the project's package.json `dependencies` or
# `devDependencies` are revised.
npm install

# All dependencies are now available. Execute any project scripts as wanted.
```
</details>

### Versioning

To publish a new release:

1. Update the [changelog](changelog.md) with release notes.
2. Commit the changelog.
3. Execute `npm version <patch|minor|major>`.

<details markdown>
<summary>Expand for exampleâ€¦</summary>

```bash
# Review the changes since the last release. For example,
# `git log "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..@" --oneline`.

# Document a new feature and a couple bug fixes since the last release. (Emacs can also be used to
# edit the changelog.)
vim changelog.md

# Stage the changelog.
git add changelog.md

# Commit the changelog.
git commit -m '[docs][changelog] prepare release notes'

# Attempt a complete release.
npm version minor
```

The NPM scripts are configured to help ensure that only tested artifacts are published on Git and
npmjs.com. Expand for detailsâ€¦
</summary>

By executing `npm version`, the following scripts are invoked in this order:
1. `preversion`: test that the workspace contains no uncommitted changes.
2. **`version`**: increment the version, clean, build, and test the candidate, commit, and tag the
	change.
3. `postversion`: call `publish`.
4. `prepublishOnly`: push the Git tag to the remote.
5. **`publish`**: push the artifacts to npmjs.com as per usual.

In detail, `version` is a built-in NPM script that increases the package.json's `version` property
(`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) as specified, commits the result to version control, and adds a Git
tag. Prior to committing the version bump, clean, build, and test the candidate artifact.  See
`npm help version` for further details.

The `preversion` NPM script, which runs prior to `version`, is defined to test that Git's version
control state is clean before that happens. No uncommitted changes are allowed! For example, imagine
if a superfluous file containing a password was unintentionally in the workspace and published to
npmjs.com.

The `postversion` NPM script, which runs after `version`, simply enforces that the `publish` NPM
script is called.

Before `publish` is executed, `prepublishOnly` pushes the current commit and tag to the Git remote.
If the push or publish fail due to connectivity, you should probably call `npm publish` directly
which will re-push the tag and archive as needed.

Finally, the `publish` script is executed which releases the raw files built into the wild at the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com). See `npm help publish` for further details.

The intended result is:
- Uncommitted changes (both modifications and untracked files) are forbidden.
- Only clean and tested packages are published.
- Git tags are available for all releases.
- Git tags pushed and NPM artifacts publishes are always in sync.

## Library design goals

- Deploy search to all test wikis before August 31, 2020: frwiktionary, hewiki, ptwikiversity,
	frwiki, euwiki, fawiki.
- Relevant, modern, efficient, iterative contributor workflows.
- Delightful user experiences shareable as an NPM package and reusable everywhere with and without
	MediaWiki.
- [Semantically versioned](https://semver.org).
