## Usage

## Version history

This library is [semantically versioned](https://semver.org). See the [changelog](changelog.md) for
release notes.

## Development

### Quick start

```bash
npm i
```

### NPM scripts

- `install` / `i`: install project dependencies. 
- `test` / `t`: run different types of tests including unit tests. See [testing](#testing).
- `version`: increment the version and publish a new release. See [versioning](#versioning).

Undocumented scripts are considered internal utilities and not expressly supported workflows.

<details markdown>
<summary><a href="http://nvm.sh">NVM</a> is recommended to configure the Node.js version used
whenever executing these scripts. Expand for exampleâ€¦</summary>

```bash
# Install the project's recommended Node.js version. This is a one-time installation command and
# does not need to be run again except when the project's .nvmrc is revised. `nvm use` will print an
# error message if this command needs to be run again.
nvm install "$(<.nvmrc)"

# Configure the current shell's environment to use the recommended Node.js version. This command
# should be run whenever opening a new shell to work on the project _prior_ to executing any of the
# project's NPM scripts, especially `npm install`.
nvm use

# Install the project's development and production dependencies. This is a one-time installation
# command and does not need to be run again except when the project's package.json `dependencies` or
# `devDependencies` are revised.
npm install

# All dependencies are now available. Execute any project scripts as wanted.
```
</details>

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
- WVUI uses [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/), 
    the official unit testing utility library for Vue.js.
- WVUI uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as a test runner. 
- Tests for every component should be colocated with the component itself:
 
```
|-- src
    |-- components
        |-- your-component
            |-- YourComponent.vue
            |-- YourComponent.test.ts
```

- WVUI uses [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing), 
    snapshot files are colocated with components as well:
 
```
|-- src
    |-- components
        |-- your-component
            |-- YourComponent.vue
            |-- YourComponent.test.ts
            |-- YourComponent.snap.ts
```
- Coverage report will be created automatically in `coverage` directory.

To run tests, use `npm test` command (see [NPM scripts](#npm-scripts)).

    
### Integrated development workflow

_Example: I want to see my local component library changes live in my app or MediaWiki skin._

Package linking is the primary _integrated_ development workflow for use when isolated development
is impractical. Tight coupling of the component library to a specific implementation is strongly
discouraged. Nevertheless, it is often the case that changes tested live in the context of a
particular use case are wanted prior to publishing. For example, perhaps a bug only manifests easily
in one target.

The steps are:

1. Clone the component library repository if you haven't already.
2. Enter the component library directory.
3. Install the component library dependencies if you haven't already (see
	[NPM scripts](#npm-scripts)).
4. Note the component library's directory. For example, `libraryDir="$PWD"`.
5. Enter your integration project's directory. For example, if you are integrating the library into
	Vector, the command might be `cd ~/dev/mediawiki/skins/Vector`. This location should contain a
	package.json with a `@wikimedia/wvui` dependency (either `dependency`,
	`devDependency`, or `peerDependency`).
6. Symbolically link the development library into the integration project via
	`npm link "$libraryDir"` where `$libraryDir` is the location of the component library. This swaps
	the published production library for a link to your local development copy.
7. Verify the link is correct by seeing where that it resolves to component library's location. For
	example, `readlink -m node_modules/@wikimedia/wvui` should match `$libraryDir`.
8. Perform all development and iteration wanted in the component library and integration project.
9. Unlink the development library via `npm unlink @wikimedia/wvui`. This deletes the
	_symlink_ to your development copy of the component library.

The above process seems a little clumsy because it is initially. However, it's quite practical and
becomes easy with practice.

### Versioning

To publish a new release:

1. Update the [changelog](changelog.md) with release notes.
2. Commit the changelog.
3. Execute `npm version <patch|minor|major>`.

<details markdown>
<summary>Expand for exampleâ€¦</summary>

```bash
# Review the changes since the last release. For example,
# `git log "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..@" --oneline`.

# Document a new feature and a couple bug fixes since the last release. (Emacs can also be used to
# edit the changelog.)
vim changelog.md

# Stage the changelog.
git add changelog.md

# Commit the changelog.
git commit -m '[docs][changelog] prepare release notes'

# Attempt a complete release.
npm version minor
```
</details>

<details markdown>
<summary>The NPM scripts are configured to help ensure that only tested artifacts are published on
Git and npmjs.com. Expand for detailsâ€¦</summary>

By executing `npm version`, the following scripts are invoked in this order:
1. `preversion`: test that the workspace contains no uncommitted changes.
2. **`version`**: increment the version, clean, build, and test the candidate, commit, and tag the
	change.
3. `postversion`: call `publish`.
4. `prepublishOnly`: push the Git tag to the remote.
5. **`publish`**: push the artifacts to npmjs.com as per usual.

In detail, `version` is a built-in NPM script that increases the package.json's `version` property
(`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) as specified, commits the result to version control, and adds a Git
tag. Prior to committing the version bump, clean, build, and test the candidate artifact.  See
`npm help version` for further details.

The `preversion` NPM script, which runs prior to `version`, is defined to test that Git's version
control state is clean before that happens. No uncommitted changes are allowed! For example, imagine
if a superfluous file containing a password was unintentionally in the workspace and published to
npmjs.com.

The `postversion` NPM script, which runs after `version`, simply enforces that the `publish` NPM
script is called.

Before `publish` is executed, `prepublishOnly` pushes the current commit and tag to the Git remote.
If the push or publish fail due to connectivity, you should probably call `npm publish` directly
which will re-push the tag and archive as needed.

Finally, the `publish` script is executed which releases the raw files built into the wild at the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com). See `npm help publish` for further details.

The intended result is:
- Uncommitted changes (both modifications and untracked files) are forbidden.
- Only clean and tested packages are published.
- Git tags are available for all releases.
- Git tags pushed and NPM artifacts publishes are always in sync.

### Editor and IDE support

Great workflows often require great tooling and those tools need to be configured. This section
describes how to optimize your editor or IDE for optimal usage.

#### Visual Studio Code

- Configure your line length to 100. For example, add common widths: `"editor.rulers": [ 80, 100 ]`.

##### Recommended extensions

- [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
	- Enable `vetur.experimental.templateInterpolationService` for HTML template type checking in
		single file components.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
	- Lower the logging level to informational by setting `cSpell.logLevel` to `"Information"`.

## Library design goals

- Deploy search to all test wikis before August 31, 2020: frwiktionary, hewiki, ptwikiversity,
	frwiki, euwiki, fawiki.
- Relevant, modern, efficient, iterative contributor workflows.
- Delightful user experiences shareable as an NPM package and reusable everywhere with and without
	MediaWiki.
- [Semantically versioned](https://semver.org).
- Thoroughly documented for development and usage; everything needed to be productive is in the
	readme.
